# todolist
The todolist was the second project done by me for the unified mentorship internship 
the basic idea is to have a classic to od list where i can add items and check mark it according to its completion 
modifications are to be made that includes 

1.Calander function- one can store to do list for specific days from the cslander 

2.Theme selection- one can personalize theme according to hos preference
